# Space Travelers' Hub

In this project, we worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API. We managed to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application allows users to book rockets, dragons, and to join selected space missions. All activities are recorded and displayed in the Profile section.
The screenshots below give a glimpse of the beautiful UI. To access the web application, click the link in the `live demo` section.
Support us with a star if you like the project, and feel free to contribute or offer any insight.
